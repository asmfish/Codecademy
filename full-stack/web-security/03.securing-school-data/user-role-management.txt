1. Create the following four permission roles:
p_students_read: permission to read the students table
p_teachers_read: permission to read the teachers table
p_students_write: permission to write to the students table
p_teachers_write: permission to write to the teachers table

$ CREATE ROLE p_students_read;
$ CREATE ROLE p_teachers_read;
$ CREATE ROLE p_students_write;
$ CREATE ROLE p_teachers_write;

2. Give permission to roles
SELECT permission ON students to p_students_read
SELECT permission ON teachers to p_teachers_read

$ GRANT SELECT ON students TO p_students_read;
$ GRANT SELECT ON teachers TO p_teachers_read;

3. Give permission to roles
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permission ON students to p_students_write
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permission ON teachers to p_teachers_write

$ GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON students TO p_students_write;
$ GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON teachers TO p_teachers_write;

4. Create two group roles 
g_school - for school employees 
g_district - for district employees

$ CREATE ROLE g_school;
$ CREATE ROLE g_district;

5. Grant permission roles p_students_read and p_teachers_read, to the group g_school

$ GRANT p_students_read TO g_school;
$ GRANT p_teachers_read TO g_school;

6. Grant the permission roles, p_students_write and p_teachers_write, to the group g_district

$ GRANT p_students_write TO g_district;
$ GRANT p_teachers_write TO g_district;

7. Create three user account roles that can login: u_principal_skinner, u_teacher_hodge, and u_it_sonia

$ CREATE ROLE u_principal_skinner WITH LOGIN;
$ CREATE ROLE u_teacher_hodge WITH LOGIN;
$ CREATE ROLE u_it_sonia WITH LOGIN;

8. Add the user role u_principal_skinner to the group g_district and the user roles, u_teacher_hodge and u_it_sonia, to the group g_school

$ GRANT g_district TO u_principal_skinner;
$ GRANT g_school TO u_teacher_hodge;
$ GRANT g_school TO u_it_sonia;

9. Lastly, add default-deny permissions. Remove all public permissions for the tables, students and teachers

$ REVOKE ALL ON students FROM PUBLIC;
$ REVOKE ALL ON teachers FROM PUBLIC;
