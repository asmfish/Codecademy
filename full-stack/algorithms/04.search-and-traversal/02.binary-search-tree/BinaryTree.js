	/*
	There are two main ways of traversing a binary tree: breadth-first and depth-first. 
	1. With breadth-first traversal, we begin traversing at the top of the treeâ€™s root node,
	displaying its data and continuing the process with the left child node and the right 
	child node. Descend a level and repeat this step until we finish displaying all 
	the child nodes at the deepest level from left to right.
	
	2. With depth-first traversal, we always traverse down each left-side branch of a tree 
	fully before proceeding down the right branch. However, there are three traversal options:

	A. Preorder(ROOT, LEFT, RIGHT) is when we perform an action on the current node first, followed by its left child node and its right child node
	B. Inorder(LEFT, ROOT, RIGHT) is when we perform an action on the left child node first, followed by the current node and the right child node
	C. Postorder(LEFT, RIGHT, ROOT) is when we perform an action on the left child node first, followed by the right child node and then the current node
