Host-Based Authentication
Your first stop is pg_hba.conf, a file that configures host-based authentication in Postgres. The pg_hba.conf file allows you to specify rules for how Postgres should handle different connections. Rules can apply narrowly or broadly, depending on how precise the parameters are.

In the pg_hba.conf file, all the entries follow the same basic format, with blank lines or lines beginning with a # symbol being ignored. The basic format of entries is:

connection_type  db  user  address  auth_method  [auth_options]
connection_type  db  user  address  auth_method  [auth_options]

1. connection_type - matches external conections using ssl or not
2. db - the database to be authenticated and authorized, all - refers to all db_customers
3. user - the user to whom to grant permission, or user who belongs to a group +g_employees for example
4. address - from which connections are allowed, samenet - allows connects from same network as postgres server.
5. auth_method - specifies the method of authentication, for example sha-256, this option could also be reject.

host db_customers +g_employees samenet scram-sha-256
host db_employees +g_hr samenet scram-sha-256
hostssl all u_owner 104.20.25.250 scram-sha-256
host all all all reject
